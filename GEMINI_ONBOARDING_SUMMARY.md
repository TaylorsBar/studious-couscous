## 🤖 Google Gemini AI Integration

### AI Service Configuration
- **Google Gemini API Key**: Unrestricted production-level access with maximum developer capabilities
- **Purpose**: Advanced AI functionality in CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows
- **Capabilities**: Plan validation, intelligent resource suggestions, compliance review, automated code generation

### Service Account Setup
- **Account Name**: `gemini-cicd-ai`
- **Display Name**: "Gemini CI/CD AI Integration"
- **Roles Assigned**:
  - Service Account Token Creator
  - Editor
- **Purpose**: Secure machine-to-machine integration with Google Cloud services
- **Credentials File**: `planar-apex-465620-m0-a9afdd3ed0b7.json` (securely stored)

---

## 🔐 Secure Credential Management

### GitHub Repository Secrets
- **Secret Name**: `GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`
- **Content**: Encrypted Google Cloud service account credentials
- **Access**: Restricted to GitHub Actions workflows and authorized automation
- **Security**: End-to-end encrypted storage within GitHub's secret management system

### Security Best Practices
✅ Credentials are encrypted at rest  
✅ Access restricted to necessary workflows only  
✅ No hardcoded credentials in source code  
✅ Regular credential rotation recommended  

**⚠️ Important**: Collaborators should review and restrict access to `GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` as needed for their specific use cases.

## 🚀 Gemini-Powered GitHub Actions Workflow

### Workflow Location
```
.github/workflows/gemini-plan-validation.yml
```

### Trigger Conditions
- **Event**: Pull Request to `main` branch
- **Execution**: Automatic on every PR

### Workflow Steps
1. **Code Checkout**: Retrieves latest code changes
2. **Environment Setup**: 
   - Python environment configuration
   - Google Cloud SDK installation
3. **Credential Loading**: Securely loads Gemini service account from secrets
4. **Dependency Installation**: Installs required Python packages
5. **Terraform Plan Generation**: 
   - Creates `plan.out` (binary format)
   - Creates `plan.json` (human-readable format)
6. **AI Analysis**: 
   - Executes placeholder Python script for Gemini integration
   - Prepares Terraform plan summary for Gemini API submission
   - Receives AI-generated validation and feedback
7. **Feedback Integration**:
   - Outputs AI suggestions in PR logs
   - Optional PR commenting capability
   - Analysis covers security, compliance, cost, and naming conventions
8. **Artifact Upload**: Preserves Terraform plans and validation scripts for review

### Current Status
🔧 **Scaffolded for Implementation**: The workflow structure is complete and ready for customization. Replace placeholder Python implementation with actual Gemini API calls using stored credentials.
